# Detecting-phishing-attack-using-machine-learning
## Description
This study aims  that detects phishing URLs from the collection of over 5,000 URLs which are randomly picked respectively and are fragmented into 80,000 training samples & 20,000 testing samples, which are equally divided between phishing and legitimate URLs. The URL dataset is trained and tested base on some feature selection such as address bar-based features, domain-based features, and HTML & javaScript-based features to identify legitimate and phishing URLs. 

Phishing attacks have gotten increasingly complex, it is very difficult for an average person to determine if an email message link or website is legitimate. Cyber-attacks by criminals that employ phishing schemes are so prevalent and successful nowadays. Hence, this project seeks to address fake URLs and domain names by identifying phishing website links. Therefore, having a web application that provides the user an interface to check if a URL is Phishing or legitimate will help decrease security risks to individuals and organizations. 
### Hardware Requirements  
• Processor: Intel Core i5 or higher  
• RAM: 8GB or more  
• Hard Disk Space: 50 GB or more  
• Graphics Card: NVIDIA or AMD with at least 2 GB memory   
### Software Requirements  
• Operating System: Windows 10 or Linux (Ubuntu)  
• Python 3.6 or higher with required libraries like Scikit-learn,TensorFlow, 
Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.  
• Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Jupyter Notebook.
## conclusion
This project can be taken further by creating a browser extension that can be installed on any web browser to detect phishing URL Links.
the model with the highest accuracy is selected and integrated to a web application that will enable a user to predict if a URL link is phishing or legitimate
